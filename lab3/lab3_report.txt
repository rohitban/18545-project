18545 Lab 3: 

In order to create audio output on our Nexys 4 FPGA we first
attempted to drive the PWM output of the board with a 10KHz
PWM signal with varying duty cycles. However, we were unable to
get any sound from the speaker. 

Subsequently, we converted a .wav file into a .coe file
to be loaded into the on board block RAM. However, we were unable
to find an encoding scheme to convert the raw signal data in the coe 
file to a 1-bit PWM output to feed into the ampPWM output port on the board.
